### TODO
1. Make it look somewhat decent

1. Add custom (short) domain 
  - `heroku config:set BASE_URL="shortdoma.in"`
1. Update form to not require `"http://"` at beginning of link
1. Add option for custom slug
  - Will need validations in case slug exists
1. Show list of currently used slugs
1. Validate for bad links 
  - test is passing on localhost, but need to validate with real URLs
